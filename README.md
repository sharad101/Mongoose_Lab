# Refactor Application: MongoDB Node Driver to Mongoose

This project involves refactoring an existing application that uses the standard MongoDB Node driver to utilize Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to replace the existing MongoDB Node driver with Mongoose to leverage the benefits of Mongoose such as schema validation, middleware, and a more streamlined API for interacting with MongoDB.


## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB and Node.js.
